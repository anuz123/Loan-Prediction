# Loan-Prediction-Using-R
The repository will show prediction of loan status using decision trees in R
The code shows sequential solving of the problem:
1) Reading the Train and Test file
2) Missing Value Imputation from the files 
3) Randomization of the data
4) Applying Decision Tree Classification Algorithm to predict the loan status for the Test file
5) Engineering the features required to improve the accuracy of the tree size
6) Final Submission of the result
